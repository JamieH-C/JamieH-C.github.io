				<p>
					I found my transition to Richmond High School relativly easy and relaxing.<br> 
					I already knew a ton of people who were going, as well as people who were already there.<br>
					All the teachers were super nice and were all happy to help us transition to high school life.<br>
					I made a few new friends in the first few days and we all sat together and talked.<br>
					<br>
					Right now my schooling has had a slight interuption due to COVID-19 as of time of writing<br>
					 almost everybody is working from home.
					I have enjoyed my online exsperience so far and I am looking forward to going back to normal school.<br>
					I have only spent 2 terms at RHS so far but I have had a great time.<br>
					I hope you also have a great time at Richmond High School.<br>
